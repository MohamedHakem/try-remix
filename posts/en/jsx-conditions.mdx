## Abstract

With React Hooks craze and the renewed functional programming talk, we need to revisit a mistake we all do in React.

Most, if not all, of us have read this quote some time in our professional life:

> In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow - Wikipedia

#### So all of us, who uses react, are writing declarative code, right?

Wrong.

## Case study

### Base example

Let's take a look on the following code:

```jsx
function App(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      {props.isUserLoggedIn ? <UserImage {...props} /> : <Avatar {...props} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Is this declarative?

no. It is **imperative**!

## Diving deep

When we write react, we tend to think of the react state as the only app state.

But if we take another look at _The Single Responsibility principle_, we clearly see that the former code breaks this principle.

#### why?

Simple. In our over simplified case, we can see that both `UserImage` an `Avatar` have the same application logic principle: they both are relying on the log in state.

## Solution

```jsx highlight=4,5,9
const UserImage = (props) => <img src={props.userImage} alt={props.userName} />;
const Avatar = (props) => <img src="images/no-user" alt="Not logged in" />;
const UserAvatar = (props) => {
  if (props.isUserLoggedIn) return <UserImage {...props} />;
  else return <Avatar {...props} />;
};

function App(props) {
  return <UserAvatar {...props} />;
}
```

When we take another look now, we can see that App component should not care how login state affects the avatar.

## What we gained

### Some more benefits to this approach

- We can add tests in a simpler way
- We can use the Newspaper code structure approach easily
- We can debug better
- We decouple the logic from the render, minimising those weird an unreadable production errors
- It will push us to use component per file approach and prevent us from having those 100 components files
- It will prevent us from having those 1000 LoC files that are pain to get into every time we need to debug or add features

Happy Reacting!
