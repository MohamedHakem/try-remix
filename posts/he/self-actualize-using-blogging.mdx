## לכתוב זה קשה

Writing a blog is not an easy task, it requires a set of skills that most of us does not poses intuitively.
I don’t either, so why do I bother?

## למה אני רציתי לכתוב

I’ve had many reasons to start a blog:

- I sought for a way to learn how to convey my ideas in a clear way
- I wanted to be able to pass my experience to others in a textual form
- I wanted to widen my professional language vocabulary
- I wanted to use is as a resting place for some of my ideas
- Everyone is doing it, right?

## זה לא בשביל הקהל

I don’t mind if the blog has audience or not. I shouldn’t mind.
The blog is for me, others just come along for the ride.
In my personal opinion, unless you know you are one of the best in some field, you should not seek to teach others.

## בלוגים צריכים להיות בשביל מימוש עצמי

We have a lot of ways to learn and self teach ourselves, one of them is writing to our own sake.

> Self-actualization is the complete realization of one’s potential, and the full development of one’s abilities and appreciation for life.

#### תחשבו על זה כמו על יומן.

People use diaries to write down their feelings, to help themselves deal with their feeling by pretending their future selfs reading it.
Basically, they talk to themselves using a paper and a pen.

We should do the same with technical blogs.
